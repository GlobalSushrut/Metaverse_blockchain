# Quantum Metaverse Platform (Research Project)

**Author**: Umesh Adhikari

**Current Status**: Late-stage Research & Development

**Developer Note**: This project has been primarily developed by a single developer (Umesh Adhikari) with limited computational resources. The core functionality is working, with only final polishing and one remaining test suite requiring attention. The project demonstrates the feasibility of a quantum-ready metaverse implementation, though scaled testing and deployment would benefit from additional resources and collaboration.

A groundbreaking quantum-ready metaverse platform that combines quantum computing principles, blockchain technology, and Web3 capabilities to create the next generation of immersive, decentralized virtual worlds. This experimental implementation serves as a foundation for research and development in quantum-safe virtual environments.

ðŸŒŸ **[Join Our Research & Development Journey](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - We welcome developers, researchers, testers, and investors to contribute to this pioneering quantum metaverse project.
